<h1 align="center">Clash of Clans - Damage Calculator</h1>
<h3 align="center">Your one-stop spot for all damage calculations in Clash of Clans</h3>

## Description
This is a convenient website focused on calculating damage in Clash of Clans. It has two main features:
- **Zapquake Calculator:** Calculates how many Lightning and Earthquake spells are needed to destroy specific defenses, just like any zapquake calculator out there. But it comes with two extra features:
  - The ability to account for hero equipment.
  - The ability to factor in donated Lightning spells.
- **Advance Calculator:** For more advanced calculations, featuring:
  - The ability to select actions such as spells, hero equipment, and troops in any order.
  - The option to manage those actions by removing or reordering them.
  - Calculations that show:
    - How much damage each action inflicts.
    - The remaining HP of the defense after each action.
    - The impact of modifiers (e.g., Rage spell, cumulative Earthquake damage).

These features may or may not be implemented in the future (depending on popular demand ðŸ‘€). Otherwise, the website is fully functional and ready to use. As always, I will update the data whenever there are new updates or balance changes coming to the game.
